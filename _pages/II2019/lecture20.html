### Networked Games

---

class: center, middle

# Networking 

---

# Why Networking?

   - Players enjoy interacting with other players
   
   - Killers like messing with people 
   
   - Achievers like having leaderboards and showing off their achievements
   
   - Socializers like interacting with other people 
   
   - AI is not (yet?) perfect
   
---

# Networking Requirements

   - Fast: Should not adversely affect gameplay

   - Reliable: (Small) connection problems should not ruin the game 
   
   - Fair: No player is preferred/affected by other player's connection problems

   - Secure: Players can't cheat
   
---

# Peer-to-Peer Games

  - In the olden days, games would simply connect all players with each other 
  
  - Every player runs the game on their machine 
  
  - When someone moves, the move is sent to all players and their copy of the game state performs it 
  
  - How can we synchronize the moves, so that all players have the same game state?
  
---

# Lockstep Networking

  - Let's assume our game has "turns"
  
  - When it is a player's turn, they send the action they perform to everyone else 
  
  - Players synchronize game states using turn order 
  
  - Note: Real-time games can use this, too, by using "very short turns" (e.g. 10ms)
  
---

# Lockstep Networking: Limitations

  - The game needs to be deterministic

  - Connection problems produce noticeable wait times 
  
  - Worse, *any* player's connection problems affect *every* player 
  
  - Also, what if the players do not agree on the game state (perhaps because someone is cheating)?

---

# Client-Server Games

  - Instead of letting every player keep track of the game state themselves, let's use a central server 
  
  - The server is the authority on the correctness of the game state, the clients only display it 
  
  - When a player wants to perform an action, a request is sent to the server, and the action is only performed if the player is allowed to do so
  
---

# Client-Server Games: Challenges

  - The server needs to respond to client requests quickly
  
  - However, there can still be a delay between the request and the answer 
  
  - Clients should (ideally) not know anything the player should not know 
  
  - What if there are network delays?

# A word from John Carmack

"While I can remember and justify all of my decisions about networking from DOOM through Quake, the bottom line is that I was working with the wrong basic assumptions for doing a good internet game. My original design was targeted at &lt; 200ms connection latencies. People that have a digital connection to the internet through a good provider get a pretty good game experience. Unfortunately, 99% of the world gets on with a slip or ppp connection over a modem, often through a crappy overcrowded ISP. This gives 300+ ms latencies, minimum. Client. User's modem. ISP's modem. Server. ISP's modem. User's modem. Client. God, that sucks. Ok, I made a bad call. I have a T1 to my house, so I just wasn't familiar with PPP life. I'm addressing it now."

---

# Client-Side Prediction

  - In the original model, if you press a button, you have to wait for the server to answer to actually move
  
  - But the client could know/expect/*predict* that the button press will cause movement 
  
  - Then, when the server confirms the coordinates, the client synchronizes with that information
  
  - Problem: The client tells the server about updates "in the past"
  
---

class: small

# Dead-Reckoning

  - Remember Newton's first law? Objects in motion will stay in motion (unless a force acts on them)
  
  - The client can assume that for non-player objects 
  
  - When the server sends another update, the client reconciles the actual information with their prediction
  
  - For example: If a character is moving forward, the client can keep moving them forward until the server tells them otherwise
  
  - The client can also use the game mechanics to predict changes in movement (e.g. through collision)
  
---

class: small

# Example: With 100ms delay

  - t = 0: Player 1 sees player 2 in crosshair and presses "fire" button, client sends the "shoot" action to the server; client 1 predicts that player 2 was hit and killed 
  
  - t = 1s: The server receives the "shoot" action from player 1, but player 2 is no longer in the crosshair 
  
  - t = 2s: Client 1 gets response from server; Player 1 missed the shot, and player 2 isn't dead after all
  
  - Player 1 feels bad, because they "definitely" hit player 2

---

# Lag Reduction

  - The server keeps track of past game states 
  
  - When a player performs an action, the server applies it to the game state at the appropriate time in the past 
  
  - This means the server must also re-apply other players' actions that happen afterwards
  
  - Advantage: Most of the time, a player's action will have the effect they see on their screen
  
---

class: small

# Example: With 100ms delay

  - t = 0: Player 1 sees player 2 in crosshair and presses "fire" button, client sends the "shoot" action to the server; client 1 predicts that player 2 was hit and killed 
  
  - t = 1s: The server receives the "shoot" action from player 1 *with the timestamp information*, and applies it to the game state at t = 0, resulting in a new game state in which player 2 is dead
  
  - t = 2s: Client 1 gets response from server, they hit player 2 and killed them
  
---

class: small

# But what about player 2?

  - t = 0: Player 2 is visible to player 1
  
  - t = 1s: Player 2 is behind a wall
  
  - t = 2s: Client 2 gets a message from the server telling them that player 2 died (at t=0)
  
  - Player 2 feels bad because they were hit "while they were behind a wall"
  
---

class: small

# Trade-off 

  - This system is actually fair: Both players have the same chances 
  
  - However, it favors active behavior, because a player's own actions are reflected in the game state more readily than actions that are performed *on* the player 
  
  - In many cases, especially in shooters, players are running towards or away from their enemies
  
  - Often the delay is also not large enough for players to actually notice, since they also need some time to process what is happening to them
  
  - Keeping track of historical states is expensive for many players
  
---

# Trust the Client?

  - As we discussed earlier: The client can not be trusted
  
  - How about Hybrid Hit Detection (such as in Battlefield 3)?
  
  - The *client* says when they hit someone 
  
  - The server performs a plausibility test

---

# Cheating 

  - The server is the authority on the game state 
  
  - However, to be able to predict movement, the client needs to know the positions of other players 
  
  - By extracting information from the binary game state, cheat programs can "see" enemies through walls 
  
  - Other cheating methods include disabling or manipulating the z-Buffer to draw hidden enemies
  
---

# Anti-Cheating measures 

There is no method that is 100% effective against all forms of cheating, but a few things that are done are:
  
  - Scan game binaries for modifications 
  
  - Look for known cheat software that is running 
  
  - Run game in a sandbox that can't be tampered with
  
  - Check for graphics card driver modifications/settings

# Player Analytics

---

# Why Player Analytics?

  - Games are expensive to make
  
  - Players often abandon games quickly
  
  - We want to know what players *do* in our games to keep them engaged
  
  - Related: We also want to make money  
  
---

# Player Analytics

  - We can collect data while players play the game 
  
  - This data can then be analyzed to answer questions/confirm hypotheses
  
  - The answers to these questions can then inform game design
  
  - Typically, you want the players to keep playing your game, and use all your content 
  
  - Or you might want to know *what kind* of content you should make more of

---

# Player Retention

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/android_retention.png" width="100%"/>

---

# Player Retention

  - Good first impression/new player experience 
  
  - Good challenge curve/flow
  
  - Delayed rewards (daily log-in bonus, loot chest with a key coming later, etc.)
  
  - Give player a personalization/progression choice
  
  - Social features, invite and team play rewards (see also: player acquisition)

# Madden NFL

  - Madden NFL is a game where you play American football 
  
  - Researchers (in collaboration with EA) analyzed game log data 
  
  - They built a statistical model to predict how many games a player would play 
  
  - Using this model, they identified features which result in higher player retention 
  
  - Game design can focus on improving these features
  
---

# Madden NFL: Features 

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/nflfeatures.png" width="100%"/>

---

# Player Modeling
  
  - You can personalize content, or just focus on more common types of players
  
  - How do you determine "types" of players?
  
  - Your game can track player actions and report back!
  
  - Especially in open world games, determining what players spend their time on is beneficial to focus future development or guide players to underexplored areas

---

# Player Profiles
  
  - On the other hand, you also want to know *who* plays your games 
  
  - Geographic region, age range, maybe personal details, personality
  
  - Why? So you can target ads 
  
  - Play patterns are also important: time of day, session length, number of games per week
  
---

# Player Profiles: How do you get this data?

  - IP Geolocation tells you the region
  
  - Provide a birthday bonus to incentivize players to tell you their birthday
  
  - Connect to facebook to get personal details
  
  - Statistical models: Play style and personality have been shown to be related 
  
---

# Machine Learning for Player Analytics

  - Some machine learning techniques can be used to analyze collected data 
  
  - For example, if we want to know which "types" of players exist, we can use clustering
  
  - If we want to *predict* what the player is likely to do, we can use supervised learning (e.g. a neural network)
  
  - We can also learn a player's preferences (e.g. which weapon they are likely to favor)
  
---

# How to use this information in Game Play
  
  - Marketing is nice and important, but can we use this for actual mechanics?
  
  - Of course!
  
  - Say a large portion of your players typically play from 7-10pm
  
  - Put large in-game events at 8pm
  
  - You can cater the type of event to the typical player population
  
---

# How to use this information in Game Play
  
  - If you know your players are going to favor a certain kind of weapon, you can focus on making more of these weapons in the future 
  
  - You can even use the learned models *during* development of future versions to predict where players might go more 
  
  - Player types can inform the kind of content you should focus on

---

# Game Play Statistics 

  - So you have your game and you collect data
  
  - Then you analyze what content which players are consuming and when
  
  - But you already invested all this time and effort?
  
  - Let's look at an example

---

# Project Gotham Racing 4

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/pgr4.jpg" width="100%"/>

---

class: small

# Project Gotham Racing 4

  - Single player *and* multi player 
  
  - 10 different game modes: career, arcade, network race, tournaments, time attack, etc.
  
  - 29 "event types": street race, elimination, cat and mouse, etc.
  
  - 134 cars with 7 different ratings (easy to hard to control)
  
  - 9 cities with a total of 121 race tracks
  
  - Development cost: "a fortune" (per Business Director Brian Woodhouse)
  
---

class: small

# Project Gotham Racing 4: Analysis

  - 4 researchers (including one from the publisher) analyzed 3.1 million game logs 
  
  - Overall, 30-40% of the content was used in less than 1% of games
  
  - Game modes: Network tournaments were used in less than 0.1% of games 
  
  - 12 of the 29 event types were used in less than 1% of games 
  
  - 50 cars were used in less than 0.25% of races
  
  - 47 race tracks were used in less than 0.5% of races *each* (13% together)
  
  
---

class: small

# Project Gotham Racing 4: What to do?

  - First observation: More is not always better 
  
  - The data can be used when developing a successor 
  
  - But there would also have been a better way to develop *this* game: 
  
     * Release a small/core version of the game with less content 
     * Add content *where it is needed*
     * You will spend less money overall, even though you provide "free content updates"
     
  - Claim: An analysis like this might cost $50-$100k, but will save $0.5-$2 million

---

# Player Acquisition

  - Marketing!
  
  - For now, let's talk about *mechanics* that encourage player acquisition

  - Once you have players, you want them to invite their friends

  - The power of social connections
  
---

class: small

# Player Acquisition 

  - Say you have a game in which you tend to *your* farm
  
  - You can make money that allows you to buy more things for your farm
  
  - Some (fancy) things you can only buy with real money, though 
  
  - Unless your friend (who also plays the game) "gives" them to you (*they* don't have to pay) 
  
  - Of course you also *have to* tend to your crops (or they die)
  
  - But a friend can help you out on your farm
  
---

# Player Acquisition: Other tactics

  - Get a bonus for posting a status on facebook that allows your friends to perform some in-game action
  
  - Make content harder to beat alone
  
  - There is a fine line between designing mechanics for player acquisition and (overly) aggressive marketing
  
  - The actual game play should still be enjoyable
  
---

# But we don't have any game yet!

  - Many of the analytics options are only available to the developers 
  
  - But there are APIs to extract replays for many games 
  
  - You can run analytics on these replays to find out what players do in *other* games to learn their preference 
  
  - This can inform design decisions for your own game

# Unity Analytics

class: small

# Unity Analytics

  - Unity has built-in support for data collection 
  
  - To enable analytics, open the Services window under Windows -&gt; General -&gt; Services and switch Analytics to "On"
  
  - By default it will collect:
  
      * New installs
      * Daily/Monthly active users 
      * Sessions (total/per user)
      * Time spent 
      * Users by geographic region, OS, life cycle
      
  - There are many other standard events you can use, or create custom ones
  
  - Also integrates with monetization options
  
---

class: small

# Unity Analytics: Funnels

  - There are many ways to analyze the collected data
  
  - One of the more common ones: Funnels 
  
  - You measure the progress through some linear progression (e.g. the tutorial)
  
  - The "funnel" will show you how far players make it through the progression, i.e. where you lose players
  
```C#
AnalyticsEvent.LevelStart(thisScene.name, 
                                      thisScene.buildIndex);
```

# Unity Analytics: Funnels
  
<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/funnels.png" width="90%"/>

---

# Unity Analytics: Heatmaps

  - You may also be interested *where* in your game things happen 
  
  - Where do players go often, where do they die 
  
  - There is a Heatmap extension for Unity analytics, where you send analytics events with a location 
  
  - Requires Unity Pro :(

# The EU General Data Protection Regulation

  - Remember getting emails from every website telling you that they collect personally identifiable information?
  
  - That's because of the EU GDPR 
  
  - Use the Unity Analytics Data Privacy Plug-in
  
  - This plug-in includes a button you can place in your game for players to opt out of data collection (and see which data was already collected)
  
  - Make sure, *you* don't send personally identifiable information in your analytics events
