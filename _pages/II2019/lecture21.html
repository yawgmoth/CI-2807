# Question 

Imagine a game where you and an opponent alternate with choosing bits for a binary number, until the number has 3 digits. If the resulting number is prime, you get points equal to its value, otherwise you lose points equal to its value. Draw the game tree for this game. What is your best first move?

Example:

You pick 0, your opponent picks 1, then you pick 1. The number is 011 in binary, or 3 in decimal, so you get 3 points.

# Physics Simulation

---

# Question 

Say you have an object with 100kg, and apply a force of 10N to it. What acceleration will the object experience?

--

If we apply this force for 5 seconds, how fast will the object be moving afterwards?

--

If the object starts at the origin (0,0,0), we apply the force for 5 seconds, where will the object be located after a total of 10 seconds? (Assume the physics simulation runs once per second)

# Question 

The coulomb model of friction states that the friction force is 

$$
F_f \le \mu \cdot F_n
$$

Explain the terms in this equation.

--

Name a scenario in which the friction force can be less than the right hand side of the equation.

# Collision Detection

---

# Question 

When is the dot product of two vectors greater than, less than, and equal to zero, (given their relative directions)?

---

# Question 

Say we have 3 spheres, S1, S2, and S3, each with radius 3. S1 is located at (0,0,0), S2 is located at (0,-4,3), and S3 is located at (3,0,4). Which of these sphere intersect, if any?


---

# Question

Let there be a sphere S1 at (8,4,2) with radius 5, and another sphere S2 with radius 1 at (0,0,0). S2 then starts moving in x-direction with 1m/s. At what time 
do the two spheres collide?

--

Hint:

You can take the position of S2 as (t,0,0), and find the (smaller) value for t for which the two spheres collide.

---

# Question

Given a ray R starting at (1,0,0), in direction (1,0,0), where is the projection of the center of the sphere S1, which is located at (8,3,4), on that ray?

--

Assume the sphere has radius 4. Does the ray intersect the sphere? 

--

Assume the sphere has radius 6. Does the ray intersect the sphere?

# Question

Given a plane going through the point (2,0,1) with normal (0,-0.71,-0.71), for each of these three points determine if it lies in front, behind or on the plane.

P1 = (2,2,2)

P2 = (0,0,0)

P3 = (3,3,-2)

---

# Question

Given a plane going through the point (1,2,3) with normal (0.71,0,-0.71), determine where a ray starting at (0,0,3) in direction (1,0,0) intersects that plane.

Recall:
$$
t = \frac{(\vec{p} - \vec{o}) \cdot \vec{n}}{\vec{d} \cdot \vec{n}}
$$

# Question 

Given the axis aligned bounding boxes (AABBs) of two objects, what can you say about the collision between the two objects if:

  - The AABBs collide?
  
  - The AABBs don't collide?
