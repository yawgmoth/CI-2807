### Artificial Intelligence

#  Game AI

# Game AI

The first rule of game AI:

### It does not matter how smart/dumb your AI is, as long as it *plays well*

---

class: center, middle

# An example 

## Let's talk about the oldest survival game in which you have to escape from the Undead 

--

## Pacman!

---

# Pacman 

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/pacman.png" width="50%"/>

---

# Pacman Ghost AI 

  * There are four ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde

  * They chase Pacman 
  
  * But they all have different "personalities"
  
  * How?
  
  * What are they actually doing?
  
---

class: small

# Pacman Ghost AI 

Some disclaimers:

  * The ghosts actually have three modes: scatter, chase and frightened 
  
  * In scatter mode each of them tries to get to his own corner 
  
  * In frightened mode, they move randomly and can be eaten 
  
  * Scatter and chase modes alternate temporally; frightened mode is triggered by eating a power-up
  
  * We will only be talking about chase mode 
  
---

# Pacman Ghost AI: The maze 

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/pacmanmaze.png" width="50%"/>

---

# Pacman Ghost AI

  * Each ghost has a current position/cell and a target position/cell 
  
  * Ghosts can not turn around
  
  * Whenever a ghost comes to an intersection, it has to decide where to go 
  
  * This decision is based on what their target is 
  
---

# Pacman Ghost AI

  * Only Blinky is actually "chasing" Pacman

  * Pinky is trying to get to where Pacman "will be"

  * Inky does something weird, his target depends on Pacman's position *and* Blinky's position
  
  * Clyde tries to chase Pacman if he is far away, but if he gets too close he will try to go back to his own corner

---

# Pacman Ghost AI: Pathfinding

  * How do the ghosts calculate the path to their target cell?
  
  * They don't!
  
  * Instead, before an intersection, they look at the next cell in each direction, and pick the direction that is closest to the target

# Pacman Ghost AI

What is the problem with this approach?

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/cantreach.png" width="80%"/>

---

# Pacman Ghost AI

  * The ghosts only make decisions one intersection at a time

  * Sometimes they reach their goal 
  
  * What we need is actual pathfinding: Calculating a route from the current position to a goal
  
  * Note: This wasn't actually a problem for Pacman, but generally we want an actual path to the goal

# Intelligence 

* We will talk about pathfinding more next week 

* But let's start with the actual behavior of NPCs 

* How about we make something "smarter" than just "go to a point"?

---

# Ad-hoc behavior
  
  * Let's start simple: We have a bandit that's walking back and forth 
  
  * Our player comes near
  
```C
if (distance(player, bandit) < x) 
{
    attack(bandit, player);
}
```

---

# Ad-hoc behavior 

  * We play with this a bit, and realize that the player can now bait ("kite") the bandit to town, where the friendly NPCs can kill him without a problem 
  
  * Let's solve that!
  
```C
if (distance(bandit, bandit_camp) > y)
{
   walk_to(bandit, bandit_camp);
}
else if (distance(player, bandit) < x) 
{
    attack(bandit, player)
}>
``` 

---

# Ad-hoc behavior 

  * Now the player can bait the bandit to the edge of his follow radius
  
  * What if the player walks back and forth on that line?
  
  * We could add another condition for that ...
  
  * Note: This does not mean that ad-hoc coding of behavior is not bad, and often works well

# AI

## What is AI?

---

# What is AI
  
  * Just like with "game", no one agrees what "AI" really is 
  
  * Commonly, "the science of intelligent agents"
  
  * Or, as Douglas R. Hofstadter said "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet"
  
  * Pathfinding "was" once AI
  
  * For games: Whatever the opponents do
  
---

class: small

# What is an agent
  
  * We often talk of "AI agents"
  
  * Each "intelligent" character in your game is an "agent"
  
  * If you play "honestly", each agent only "knows" what a player would know if they could play as that character
  
  * For example: If you have a bandit, it can't see the player if the player is behind an obstacle
  
  * The agent uses their knowledge to make determine which action to use
  
  * Note: It's not mandatory to play "honestly" for the AI agents

# Some AI techniques

## (that are commonly used in games)

---

# Decision Trees

  * Remember the series of if statements from earlier?
  
  * We can represent them as a tree 
  
  * Each branch is one if statement, based on some condition 
  
  * The leaves of the trees are actions the character takes 
  
---

# Decision Trees

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/decisiontree.png" width="100%"/>

---

# Decision Trees: Limitations

  * We haven't actually changed anything from the if statements (other than drawing them)
  
  * Designing a decision tree is still a lot of manual work
  
  * There's also no persistence, the agent will decide a new behavior every time the tree is evaluated
  
  * There is one nice thing: Decision trees can (sometimes) be learned with Machine Learning techniques

---

# Finite State Machines

  * We can make our code nicer if we separate decisions and behavior 
  
  * For example: Wandering around is one behavior, attacking the player another, etc.
  
  * Each of these behaviors is a "state" of the bandit 
  
  * The bandit decides when to change states depending on the game state 

---

# Finite State Machines 

<img src="/CI-2700/assets/img/fsm.png" width="100%"/>

---

class: small

# Finite State Machines: Limitations

  * There's no real concept of "time", it has to be "added" 

  * If you just want to add one state you have to determine how it relates to every other state 

  * If you have two Finite State Machines they are hard to compose 
  
  * It's also kind of hard to reuse subparts
  
  * For example: A guard has a routine consisting of multiple states to chase an intruder, the bandit could use that same routine, but it would connect differently to the rest of its behavior

---

# Hierarchical Finite State Machines

  * Finite State Machines define the behavior of the agent 
  
  * But we said the nodes are behaviors?!
  
  * We can make each node another sub-machine!
  
  * This leads to *some* reusability, and eases authoring  
  
---

class: small

# Behavior Trees

  * Let's still use a graph, but make it a tree!
  
  * If we have a subtree, we now only need to worry about one connection: its parent
  
  * The *leaves* of the tree will be the actual actions, while the interior nodes define the decisions 
  
  * Each node can either be successful or not, which is what the interior nodes use for the decisions
  
  * We can have different kinds of nodes for different kinds of decisions 
  
  * This is extensible (new kinds of nodes), easily configurable (just attach different nodes together to make tree) and reusable (subtrees can be used multiple times)
  
---

# Behavior Trees: Common Node types

  * Selector: Execute the first child that is successful 
  
  * Sequence: Execute all children until one fails
  
  * Loop: Keep executing child (or children) until one fails 
  
  * Random choice: Execute one of the children at random
  
  * Timing: Execute first child for x seconds, then the second child, etc.

# Let's make a Behavior Tree for a Bandit!

  * She can walk somewhere
  
  * She can see the player 
  
  * She can sound the alarm
  
  * She can hear the alarm of the bandit camp
  
  * She can attack the player

# AIIDE 2019

* I was in Atlanta for a conference last week: Artificial Intelligence in Interactive Digital Entertainment

* There were presentations about content generation, narrative, machine learning in games, etc. 

* There were also some demos, like the fantastic "Playing with SHRDLU", a game featuring natural language conversations with robots
