* As I mentioned, I went to a conference last week 

* It was very interesting!

* There was a panel of the IGDA's games education curriculum

* I also talked to many people about potential future projects

# FDG 2019

Why am I telling you all this?

* Conferences are an important part of academia

* It's nice to get out of your bubble, collaborations spark innovation

* UCR/ECCI benefits from increased recognition in the research community

* Maybe some of you want to work on a master's and/or PhD thesis?

# Unity

---

# Controller support

  * Controller support is very easy!
  
  * Just use Input.GetAxis, Input.GetButton etc.
  
  * Controllers should work out of the box!

---

# Particle Systems 

  * Consist of a generator and particle properties
  
  * The generator emits particles 
  
  * Particles are usually simple sprites with colors
  
  * Can be used to make nice fire, smoke, etc.
  
  * Built-in system in Unity!

# Animations 

  * Animations in Unity use two parts: 
     
      - Animator Component
      - Animation Controller
      
  * Of course you also need Animation Clips
  
  * You can make your own to animate basically anything
  
  * Window - Animation - Animation (or Ctrl+6)
  
---

# Animations

class: small

# Animator

* The Animator defines which animation clips are played at what time 

* This is done with a state machine (the Animation Controller), with transitions between states when conditions are satisfied

* For example, when the movespeed is sufficiently high, an idle animation turns into a walk animation, and when the speed further increases that turns into a run animation

```C#
GetComponent<Animator>().SetFloat("movespeed", movespeed);
```

# Coroutines 

  * Remember threads?
  
  * Sometimes all you want is for a function to run independently, pause for a bit and then continue
  
  * Or you need to wait for a download of some resource 
  
  * Use Coroutines! They run in the main thread, and can use all Unity API functions 
  
  * Alternative: IJob interface
  
---

# Coroutines 

```C#
IEnumerator HighlightGO(GameObject go)
{
  MeshRenderer renderer = go.GetComponent<MeshRenderer>();
  if (renderer == null) 
      yield break;

  Color original = renderer.material.color;
  renderer.material.color = Color.white;

  yield return new WaitForSeconds(3);
  renderer.material.color = original;
}

...
StartCoroutine(HighlightGO(someGameObject));
```

---

class: small

# Raycasts 

   * Sometimes you want to know what the user clicks
   
   * `Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);`
   
   * `Physics.Raycast(ray, out res)`
   
   * Returns true if you hit anything
   
   * You will get information about what you hit in `res`
   
   * Also works with other rays (targeting, line-of-sight calculations, etc.)



---

# Raycasts

```C#
if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0))
{
    Ray ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
    
    RaycastHit res;
    if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out res))
    {
        StartCoroutine(HighlightGO(res.collider.gameObject));
    }
}
```

---

# Prefabs

  * Prefabs are collections of game objects and components that you want to reuse

  * Assemble in Scene, drag into Assets 

  * You can edit the Prefab separately (since Unity 2018.3)
  
---

# Prefabs

Create a fireball: 

```C#
if (Input.GetButtonDown("Fire1")) {
    Ray ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition);
    Instantiate(fireball, transform.position + 
                          ray.direction * 0.5f, 
                 Quaternion.LookRotation(-ray.direction));
}
```

Fireball:
```C#
void Update() {
   transform.position += transform.rotation * 
               (new Vector3(0, 0, -5) * Time.deltaTime);
}

private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other) {   
    Destroy(gameObject);
}
```

---

# Tags and Layers 

  * You can assign Tags and Layers to game objects 
  
  * Tags can be used to tell you which type of game object you have (player, enemy, etc.)

  * Layers are used by the Camera to determine what to show 
  
  * Can also be used by Raycast to ignore certain objects 

---

# Render-to-Texture 

  * Usually, Cameras render what they see to the screen
  
  * You can also set up a Camera to render to a texture 
  
  * And then put that texture onto a game object 
  
  * Model surveillance cameras, add a minimap, mirrors, portals, etc.

# Render-to-Texture 

.left-column[
<img src="/CI-2807/assets/img/cullingmask.png" width="100%"/>
]

.right-column[
* Create a second camera 
  
* Select which layers that camera should render (avoid showing particle systems, use different symbol for the player on minimap, etc.)
  
* For a minimap you probably want to set the camera projection mode to "Ortographic"
]

# Some Further Notes

  * Use [this .gitignore](https://github.com/yawgmoth/UnityDemo2D/blob/master/.gitignore) file when working with Unity projects in git 
  
  * **Be careful** with scenes: Only one person can edit a scene at the same time (git merge will most likely **not** work)
  
  * It's easiest if everyone has their own scene to develop their parts

# ASODEV Costa Rica

  - Asociación de Desarrolladores de Videojuegos de Costa Rica 
  
  - One of the goals of the organization is to grow the games industry in Costa Rica 

  - For this year's GDC they had 16 (free) passes that they gave out to applicants 
  
  - Every first Wednesday of the month they have a breakfast, 10-12am, at Match Cafe!
