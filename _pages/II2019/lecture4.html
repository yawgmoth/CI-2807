# Achievements 

  * In addition to goals (as we discussed last time), games provide players with "achievements"
  
  * The distinction is sometimes a bit blurry 
  
  * Often, though, games use achievements as "bonus"/optional goals

# Game Design Document

# Game Design Document (GDD)

A living, changing document containing
  
  * Game Pitch ("hook")
  
  * Setting
  
  * Rules (interactions)
  
  * Goals 
  
---

# Game Design Document

  * GDDs have been described as "obsolete"
  
  * Prototyping has become easier
  
  * There is usually still *some* documentation about a game before it is actually implemented
  
  * GDDs differ from company to company 
  
---

# Game Pitch

  * The most important part of the GDD 
  
  * You want the reader to become interested ("hooked")
  
  * One approach: Relate to an existing game and provide a twist
  
  * Another approach: Mention a unique idea/setting/mechanic
  
  * In practice, also: Argue using proven concepts

# Ideation

  * What do you want players to feel/experience?
  * What mechanics do you want to incorporate?
  * What do you see in the world around you?
  * Which games are already fun?
  * Which technology is available?
  * Which art assets, world, IP do you have?
  * Who do you want to play your game?
  * Random page on wikipedia, tvtropes, a dictionary, ...
  
---

# Setting

  * Characters 
  
  * World 
  
  * Story
  
  * Not applicable to all games (Tetris?)
  
---

# Characters

  * Personality
  
  * Goals 
  
  * Relationships, conflicts
  
  * Who is the player?
  
---

# World

  * Time/technological level 
  
  * Location, real or fictional 
  
  * Relevant factions/groups
  
  * Where is the player?
  
---

# Story

  * Characters want to achieve their goals 
  
  * Conflicting goals result in obstacles
  
  * What does the player need to do?
  
  * How does the player progress through the story?
  
  * Non-linear stories, sandbox games

# Name a popular story!

# Popular Story

## Game?

---

# Rules/mechanics

  * Objects, attributes, and relationships
  
  * Describes gameplay formally and provides basis for implementation
  
  * What does the player do in the game/how is it challenging?
  
  * Informal description is helpful
  
  * Compare to design in software engineering
  
---

# Goals

  * What is the player supposed to achieve?
  
  * Is there a win/loss condition, quests, etc.
  
  * Why should someone play the game?
  
  * Not always a clear answer
  
---

# Aesthetics

  * What should the game look/feel like 
  
  * Art assets (<a href="https://opengameart.org/">opengameart.org</a>, Unity asset store)
  
  * UI Style
  
  * Sound?
  
  * Can provide concept art, prototype screenshots, etc.
   
---

# For the project 

  * Team name, game name 
  
  * Rules and goals for the game
  
  * Setting/story, if applicable
  
  * Team members and relevant skills

---

# For the project 

  * Team name, game name 
  
  * <b>Rules and goals for the game</b>
  
  * Setting/story, if applicable
  
  * Team members and relevant skills
  
---

# For the project 

  * I want you to think about your game in a formal way 
  
  * List the objects, attributes, and relationships explicitly
  
  * You should also provide a textual description of the rules and goals
  
  * If you have any prototype screenshots or diagrams, feel free to include them, but they are not required
  
---

class: small

# For the project 

  * Choose an appropriate level of abstraction 
  
  * Be **consistent** 
  
  * There should be a description of:
     - What the player can do 
     - How the game reacts
     - What the goal is
     
---

# For example: Hoverrace

  * [Hoverrace](/CI-2700/assets/unity/winbuild.zip) is a small game I made as a demo for the course
  
  * It is a racing game set on a lake, with high speed hovercrafts that can slide around corners
  
  * Makes heavy use of the Unity physics engine
  
  * We'll recreate most of it during one of the Unity classes

# Example GDD

## <a href="/CI-2700/assets/pdf/GDD.pdf">Hoverrace GDD</a>

---

# Objects and Attributes

  * You can also put the objects and attributes into a table, or tables 
  
  * Or draw a (sort of) class diagram
  
  * Consistency is key

---

class: small

# From the design document to a game

  * Like in software engineering, the design document tells you how to start implementing
  
  * Objects fall into three categories:
  
     - Objects with behavior (code)
     
     - Passive scene objects 
     
     - Abstract objects (buttons)
     
  * In Unity: Create a scene, and populate with objects 
  
  * Add behavior/code step by step

* Player
   
* AI Opponent
   
* Checkpoints 
   
* Terrain, water
   
* UI
   
* etc
]

# Further notes on game design

  * Try to play games with an open eye
  
  * Explicitly identify objects, attributes and relationships
  
  * Think about *why* objects relate in a certain way
  
  * What could you change about the game to keep it the same/similar, what would change it 
  
  * Exploit behavior, find unintended functionality
  
---

# Every Frame a Painting

  * Don't assume that any detail is added randomly
  
  * Game designers have very particular experiences in mind 
  
  * Compare to films: Very subtle effects are used intentionally by the directors
 
  * Warning: This may change your experience of games (or movies)

# Story Time!

---

# Apex Legends 

  * Apex Legends was released earlier this year

  * "The Next Evolution of Battle Royale", published by EA
  
  * Very popular game, reaching 50 Mio downloads in less than a month
  
  * Free to play with monetization in the form of cosmetic items 
  
---

# Apex Legends: Iron Crown Event 

  * About a week ago, an in-game event called "Iron Crown" started 
  
  * It added 25 new cosmetic items
  
  * One of them, a legendary axe, could only be obtained after a player had the other 24
  
  * The items are contained in loot boxes, which cost $7 each
  
  * Only 2 loot boxes could be obtained for free by playing the game 
  
---

# Apex Legends: Controversy

  * The legendary axe basically costs $170
  
  * Forbes, a **financial/business magazine** called this price "hilariously out of touch"
  
  * Players were equally unhappy
  
  * Reddit was fuming 
  
---

# Apex Legends: How **not** to do PR 

  * At this point, the developers could have apologized and fixed things 
  
  * They apologized ...
  
--

  * And told players that they could also buy items for $18/piece (without the loot box)
  
  * Somehow, players were still not happy

# Next Week

class: medium

# Next Week: FDG

  * I will be in California next week, to present a paper at the conference "Foundations of Digital Games" (FDG)
  
  * FDG is an interesting place, because there are many different kinds of games researchers there 
  
  * My paper is a collaboration with Daniel Gruss from University of Technology Graz, Austria
  
  * We present a communication method for Hanabi that uses timing rather than explicit communication 
  
  * Since computers can measure timing very precisely, we can transmit a lot of information this way, which helps a lot with the game
  
---

class: medium

# Next Week: Labs

  * While I am gone, you will get to play with Unity 
  
  * I have prepared two tutorials you should work through 
  
  * I have reserved Lab 105 for this purpose during normal class hours, and Ruben will be present to help you if you get stuck 
  
  * You can find the labs [on the website](/CI-2807/labs)
