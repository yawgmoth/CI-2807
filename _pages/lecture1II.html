# The Project 
  
  * The main focus of this class is the *project*
  
  * There will be *one* semester-long project 
  
  * In this project, you will design, implement and finish a game 
  
  * Work in groups of 4
  
  * Three milestones: Design document, prototype, finished game 
  
  * Progress update *every Tuesday* (usually 5 minutes per group)
  
---
  
# Project Goal
  
  * You can make any game you want (more or less)
  
  * Requirements
  
     - Single player play has to be possible
     
     - Three distinct zones/levels/maps/environments
     
     - Some form of computer-controlled characters with "interesting" behavior ("AI")
     
     - Unity strongly recommended, other options only with prior approval
     
---
  
# Status Updates
  
  * Every Tuesday I want you to tell me about your progress 
  
  * Keep your presentations to five minutes 
  
  * It's OK if progress is slower some weeks 
  
  * Every game should have a website where you post screenshots, or even WebGL builds, that you can use for the presentations 
  
  * Not every team member is required to speak, except at the first presentation next week where you introduce your group

# Unity 

  * Unity is a game engine/middleware that simplifies many aspects of game development
  
  * Free for personal/educational use!
  
  * Asset store with many free assets
  
  * WebGL export capabilities
  
  * Install as soon as possible!
  
---
  
# Lectures
  
  * The lectures work alongside the project
  
  * There are some lectures that teach concepts necessary for the project early on
  
  * Other lectures contain theory and more advanced algorithms and methods
  
  * If the need arises, I can shuffle lectures around
  
  * There will be *two* exams, mid-term and final 
  
  * Questions about *your* project might be part of the exam

---
  
# Support
  
  * You will be learning Unity/C# as part of the project 
  
  * Many excellent tutorials online
  
  * If you encounter problems: Ask on Piazza, maybe others have encountered similar problems
  
  * Help each other! 
  
  * Of course I will also be answering questions
  
---
  
# Project Ideas
  
  * You can choose between 2D and 3D
  
  * 2D is slightly easier, but don't be afraid of making a 3D game
  
  * Look through games from the last two semesters to get an idea for the scope 
  
  * There's a high chance you'll present an idea and I'll tell you to reduce the scope 
  
  * Even the simplest idea can be polished and improved almost endlessly
  
---
  
# Some Project Ideas
  
  * A shooter game in which you defend a medieval town that's located in the middle of a frozen lake with a bow and arrow. You can walk on the lake, but you'll slide around. 

  * Because Winter is Coming!

  * Some Assets:
  
      - [MedievalTownExteriors](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/medieval-town-exteriors-free-27026)
      - [Peasants](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/lowpoly-medieval-world-lowpoly-medieval-peasant-122225)
      - [Modular Fantasy Bridges](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/modular-fantasy-bridges-99940)
      - [Zombie](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/zombie-30232)

---

# Some Project Ideas 

  * An incremental/idle game (like [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/), [Kittens Game](http://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/), [Crusaders of the Lost Idols](http://www.codenameentertainment.com/?page=idle), etc.) in which your champion (or champions) fights monsters on your behalf, while collecting coins and equipment (or parts, and you can craft items?). 
  
  * Some Assets:
     
     - [Space Worm](https://opengameart.org/content/space-worm)
     - [RPG Weapon Icons](https://opengameart.org/content/swords-maces-staves-dawnbringer32-palette)
     - [Armor Icons](https://opengameart.org/content/armor-icons-32x32-px-painterly)

---

# Some Project Ideas 

  * A wizard school game, where the player has to learn different spells by drawing the right shape on the screen with the mouse. The shapes for the spells (and 
  maybe the names, too?) could be auto-generated.
  
  * Avada Kedavra!
  
  * Some Assets:
      
      - [Spell Icons](https://opengameart.org/content/spells-icons)
      - [Wands](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/weapons/3d-items-free-wand-pack-46225)
      - [Fantasy GUI](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/fantasy-wooden-gui-free-103811)

# To Dos
  
  * Find a group for the project (Piazza)
  
  * Give your group a name (can be funny, a pun, a reference)
  
  * Work on 3-5 game ideas, think about what you want to generate
  
  * Present your group, name, and game ideas next Tuesday, August 20
  
  * Each group has 10 minutes!
