# What's so great about Star Wars?

  * "It is a period of <b>civil war</b>. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic <b>Empire</b>. "
  
  * "*Tarkin*: The <b>Imperial Senate</b> will no longer be of any concern to us. I have just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently."
  
  * "*Leia*: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the <b>more star systems</b> will slip through your fingers."
  
  * "*Vader*: A tremor in the Force. <b>The last time</b> I felt it was in the presence of <b>my old master.</b>"

# What's so great about Star Wars?

  * The story does not *need* these references
  
  * But they give the story *context*
  
  * And a *purpose*
  
  * They allow audiences to imagine their own story within the larger world

# What about Video Games?

  * There are Star Wars games ...
  
  * Skyrim: Dragons were created by one of the gods
  
  * Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans (1994): Orcs come from <b>another world</b>, Draenor<br/>World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade (2007): Players can visit what's left of Draenor: Outland
  
  * Overwatch: "Long before she took up the alias "Sombra," Olivia Colomar was among the thousands of children who were left orphaned in the aftermath of the Omnic Crisis."
  
  * Stardew Valley: Pelican Town is located within the Ferngill Republic, at war with the Gotoro Empire across the Gem Sea

# What are good worlds?

  * They are intuitive
  
  * Can be used to tell many stories
  
  * Are about wish/fantasy fulfillment
  
  * Allow discovery
  
  * Are different from the real world

# Name a (well-known) world!

  * Intuitive?
  
  * Stories?
  
  * Wishes/Fantasies?
   
  * Discovery?
  
  * Not RL?

# Game Design Challenge  

### Let's Design a Board Game!

---

# The Game

  * What's the central theme of the game?
  
  * Who are the players in the game?
  
  * What are the players competing for (or collaborating on)?
  
  * Which mechanics could that translate to?
  
---

# Mechanics 

  * Which resources are there? (turns, cards, moves, etc. also count)
  
  * How does one resource convert to another? (e.g. a player may spend one coin to move their meeple)

  * What do we need on the board?
  
  * What do players do?
